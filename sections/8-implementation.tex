Flattening gadget $G$ and it's inverse (bit decomposition matrix $G^-1$)
The invariant
NAND (potentially XOR and AND)

\section{GSW scheme}
the actual scheme

\section{Security of GSW}
Assume A is uniformly random. Then it is enough to show that C is statistically close to a random matrix because we can use leftover hash lemma to show that C is statistically close to a random matrix even if A is pseudorandom, as per LWE assumption.
